Hey, this was/is my first programing project ever. I got to do this for school lecture in Web-Technology class. 
The thing is i started to late and i rushed and did a lot of code with chat gpt, that resulted to a lot of bugs and my bad undestanding of what i did. 
THE GOAL: of corse is to improve it and make the code as clean a possible and keep it that way. 

If anyone is up for a challange and wants to beat me in improving it and make it functional, please do not hesitate to join. 

Anyway let'start learning.
